# Telecom_Churn_Prediction_Assignment
This is to predict the churn probability of a telecom organization. 

**General Information**
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

**Business Objective**: TThe company wants to have a prediction algorithm to get the churning probability of the telecom organisation. 



We are using the Loan Data set with the information of telecom customer along with their usage for 3 months as training dataset and another test dataset against which predictions are to be made.

**Technologies Used:**
Python - version 3.9
